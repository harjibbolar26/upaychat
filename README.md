## Getting Started

The projects showcases 6 different types of card services UpayChat can possibly render as a financial protocol.

They include Debit Card, Credit Card, Prepaid Card, Travel Rewards Card, Student Credit Card and Business Credit Card.

Everyone who would possibly use the internet and come across our services at UpayChat through our brilliantly implemented Optimization in the Search Engine was factored in when decidiing the type of card service to be offered.

From the elite business men and women, to the petty-traders, to Students at various levels, to HNIs, and even to middle-class citizens - everyone would be able to benefit from the perks of our card services.

The project also has a feature to recommend a card type fro you just incase you don't know which one should you should opt for. Only few data are needed and you will be given the options to select any of two cards and opt for them.
